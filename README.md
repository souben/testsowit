This project is simple app about drawing polygons in maps and calculate their total area, then save in the databse to later (fetch it, delete it or update it).
Tools for the project are : 
  - back-end : django
  - front-end : angular
  - carte : mapbox
  - base de donn√©es : postgres sql
  - docker
when dealing where maps with dealing with spatial data ,so I decided to use Postgis which is an extension of Postgresql to store this kind of data.
